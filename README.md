# Fractals
This project is about creating graphically beautiful fractals. A fractal is a mathmatical object, which repeats it's pattern at every scale. I will present the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set. I rendered the Mandelbrot and the Julia-set: The mathematical definition of the Julia-set J(f)={z in C | |f(z)| <= C } and the Mandelbrot
z_n+1 = z_n+1 + c
