## Introduction
This project focuses on generating graphically stunning fractals. A fractal is a mathematical object that repeats its pattern at every scale. In this project, we will explore the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set using the classic iterative function:

𝑧_{𝑛 + 1} = 𝑧_{𝑛}² + 𝑐

To generate these fractal images, we will use the MiniLibX graphics library. The primary goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of event handling and complex numbers while creating visually appealing fractals.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:WaPoco/fract-ol.git fractol
